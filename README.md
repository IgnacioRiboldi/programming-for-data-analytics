# Task 2
Different sources:
On below sources I got some examples of different ways I could do this assignment.
At first I was trying to get unique bank holidays that were not included in other regions than Nothern Ireland, and I was getting as result three times each of them since they had different dates.

As I just wanted to show the titles I manage to use the code as in the third link example to finally just have one time titles.

# Task 3

With information provided by the professor and doing a little research on matplotlib official website, I manage to complete the task 3 with no further complications.

Part of the coding was taken from lecture: Where I got the code to import the URL, to remove columns, and to filter by sex
