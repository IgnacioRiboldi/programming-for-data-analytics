# Task 2
Different sources:
On below sources I got some examples of different ways I could do this assignment.
At first I was trying to get unique bank holidays that were not included in other regions than Nothern Ireland, and I was getting as result three times each of them since they had different dates.

As I just wanted to show the titles I manage to use the code as in the third link example to finally just have one time titles.
